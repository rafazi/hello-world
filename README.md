# hello-world
Just beginning.
Hi there! I'm getting into the Software Engineering world. I'm already enrolled in a BSc at Instituto Infnet (Brazil), and I'm considering attending others schools/academys simultaneously, for now as I write, such as LaunchSchool, 42School, and CodingNomads, to name a few. I'm diving right in, and this is a message for my future self.
